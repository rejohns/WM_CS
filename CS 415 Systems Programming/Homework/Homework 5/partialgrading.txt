Programming Assignment 5: Partial Grading Form

16 of the 30 points are given here.

============================================================


NOTE: all tests should be run on the system named bg1. This
      machine is effectively a 16 processor 64-bit system.
      I have disabled nscd on bg1 to make DNS lookups slower.

0. System build. [2 points total]

   [1 pt]  Unpack submission into directory. Make that directory
           the cwd. A simple "make" should build the binary.

1. Basic operation [15 points total]:

   Copy 100line and 1000line from the web page into the
   directory where the program is to be tested.

a. [5 pts] Execute the following command to check basic i/o and
           counting:

	   ./refstats -b 4 -N 2 -d 0 -D 0 100line

           Simply check the output for correctness.

b. [5 pts] Execute the following command to check multi-thread
           operation:

	   ./refstats -b 4 -N 2 -d 1000 -D 1000 100line
	   
           Note that there is a 1 second delay associated with
	   reading from the buffer and after a DNS lookup.
	   This should let you run "ps -eLf" in another window to
	   see 4 threads: main, reader, and 2 lookup threads.

	   Also check that the execution of the program is
	   consistent with the 1 sec delays.

	   Output must also be correct.

           NOTE: if program is not multi-threaded, no credit will
           be received for grading items 1, 2, and 3.

2. LRU Cache Management [10 points total]:
                                          
a. [5 pts] Execute the following:
           
	   ./refstats -b 1 -N 100 -d 0 -D 0 100line 
	   
           Compare the cache hit rate with the hand-computed hit rate.
           The cache is big enough so that only the first appearance of
           an IP address will cause a fault.
