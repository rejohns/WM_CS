Programming Assignment 3: Grading Form
----------------------------------------

STUDENT NAME:  Johns, Robert E.
  
GRADE: [30/30]
SLIP DAYS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT: 0
CUMULATIVE SLIP DAYS: 0

============================================================

Setup:
  TA will create a directory in which he will copy your source
  files. He will cd to that directory, compile your source, and
  will create two symbolic links, even and odd, to your evenodd
  binary. Testing will be done in this context.

1. Normal operation [15 points total]

     driver ~kearns/public/415/p3/fortunes > output

a) [1 pt] Ensure a 4 process system is created by doing a "ps axu"
   in another window on the computer on which the grading is being
   done.  1 

b) [1 pts] Redirection to output file done.   1

c) [1 pts] Asterisks output as required.  1

d) [6 pts] Correct number of instances of the word "the" in the
   output file.  6

e) [1 pts] Proper termination without zombies (check with a "ps axu").  1

f) [1 pts] Visual inspection of source to ensure that no "tricks"
   used to detect EOF on pipes.  1

g) [1 pt] Even and odd are the same binary; argv[0] used to determine
   which identity a process assumes (visual inspection of source).  1

h) [3 pts] EODELAY: As a baseline, run
     time driver ~kearns/public/415/p3/smallfortunes
   to get a feel for execution time. Then run
     ( export EODELAY=2; time driver ~kearns/public/415/p3 smallfortunes )
   to see if the 2 second delay per word processes by even/odd makes
   the noticeable difference in runtime and number of asterisks that
   it should.  3

2. Odd cases [10 points total]

a) [2 pts] Sane response to
     driver /dev/null
   without special casing the name of the file. Visual inspection to
   ensure no special-casing; run the program, see the asterisks, and
   get no real output.   2

b) [2 pts] Sane response to
     driver ./does_not_exist
   Acceptable if the system is created, runs to a clean termination,
   and doesn't output any counts. Better if driver dies as soon as it
   finds it cannot open the file, before creating any processes.   2

c) [2 pts] Bad EODELAY:
     (export EODELAY=bogus; driver ~kearns/public/415/p3/fortunes)
   Should run, but without error or delay.  2

d) [2 pts] Piped output:
     driver ~kearns/public/415/p3/fortunes | grep the  2

e) [2 pts] Only words with an odd number of characters:
     driver ~kearns/public/415/p3/onlyodd  2


3. Standalone operation of even [5 points total]

a) [5 pts] Even without the rest:
     even 0 < ~kearns/public/415/p3/onlyeven
   Should work without errors, especially those related to signals. 5
