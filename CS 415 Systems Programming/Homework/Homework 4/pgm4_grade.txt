SLIP DAYS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT: 0
CUMULATIVE SLIP DAYS: 0

0. Building the system. [2 points total]: 2
 a. A single "make" should build TTT and ttt.

1. Basic operation: single game, everything done quickly enough to
   avoid timeouts. cd to directory where binaries reside before
   starting server or clients in all cases. [14 points total]: 14/14
 a. [2 pts] Bring up TTT; ensure shared file created.  2
 b. [2 pts] Bring up first ttt; specify handle and await match.  2
 c. [2 pts] Bring up second ttt; specify handle and see that
            the match is established.  2
 d. [4 pts] Play a game so that one player wins; see winner
            announced; see clients terminate and server survive.  4
 e. [4 pts] With the surviving TTT still running, repeat the above
            to play a second game to a draw.  4

2. Query Mode. [6 points total]:  6/6
 a. [4 pts] Bring up a new TTT (after killing old one).Establish
            match as above. Make a couple of moves. Do a
            "ttt -q". Must get status and see the client terminate
            without any additional activity on the part of the clients
            playing the game.  4
 b. [2 pts] Play above game to completion. Leave server running.
            A new “tty -q” should generate a proper response. 2

3. Timeouts. [8 points total]: 8/8
 a. [4 pts] Bring up server. Bring up a single client with
            "ttt -t 120". Should time out in after about 2 minutes.  4
 b. [4 pts] Kill server and ensure that control file is deleted.
            Bring up query client with "ttt -q". Should see the client
            time out in about 60 seconds. Make sure that a real client
            invoked with "ttt" also times out in about 60 seconds if
            the control file is missing (some slop is permitted in
            this case.)   4

4. Queued clients. [4 points total]:
 a. [4 pts] Bring up server. Bring up 2 clients and start a game. In
            the middle of the game, bring up 2 more clients. Continue
            the game to completion. Must see the queued clients now
            start a new game. 4 

5. Abnormal conditions. [6 points total]:
 a. [4 pts] Bring up a fresh TTT. Establish a match as above. Make a
            couple of moves. Kill (with a kill -9) one client. Server
            should detect, match should be aborted, server should
            be able to establish a new match without being restarted. 4
 b. [2 pts] Bring up a fresh TTT. Establish a match with 2 ttt clients.
            Bring up 5 more ttt clients. Ensure that the first 4 get
            queued but the 5th gets rejected. 2
