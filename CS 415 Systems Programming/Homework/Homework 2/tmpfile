./files/computers:169:	A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the
./files/computers:170:program on which he was working.  "I will be finished tomorrow," the programmer
./files/computers:172:	"I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager. "Truthfully,

./files/computers:192:employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"
./files/computers:193:	But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist

./files/computers:272:	The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has
./files/computers:273:gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system
./files/computers:274:crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the
./files/computers:276:has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within
./files/computers:277:themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has
./files/computers:278:entered the mystery of the Tao."
./files/computers:281:	A novice asked the master: "I have a program that sometimes runs and
./files/computers:282:sometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally
./files/computers:283:baffled. What is the reason for this?"
./files/computers:285:the Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.  Why
./files/computers:287:simulate determinism; only the Tao is perfect.
./files/computers:288:	The rules of programming are transitory; only the Tao is eternal.
./files/computers:289:Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment."
./files/computers:290:	"But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?" asked the
./files/computers:292:	"Your program will then run correctly," replied the master.
./files/computers:295:	A novice asked the master: "I perceive that one computer company is
./files/computers:296:much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a giant
./files/computers:302:servant.  But because it combines all of these things, people think it one

./files/computers:321:	The Chief Priest had been in the temple for many years and could be

./files/computers:325:	With that, the Chief Priest went to lunch.  The novice suddenly
./files/computers:339:but not the slightest mention of anything financial.

./files/computers:341:"Don't be so impatient," he said, "I'll put the financial stuff in eventually."
./files/computers:344:	A novice was trying to fix a broken lisp machine by turning the

./files/computers:365:	If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
./files/computers:366:disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite the

./files/cookie:336:At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seemingly

./files/cookie:402:The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write

./files/cookie:404:than the schedule allowed.
./files/cookie:406:The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
./files/cookie:407:the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be 
./files/cookie:408:well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if
./files/cookie:409:the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs

./files/cookie:1239:The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only
./files/cookie:1240:opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts
./files/cookie:1241:at rational thinking.  Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of
./files/cookie:1242:knowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable.  Since the earliest
./files/cookie:1243:days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
./files/cookie:1244:effort to liberate the body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and
./files/cookie:1245:everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
./files/cookie:1246:laws, bad social theories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an
./files/cookie:1247:apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.
./files/cookie:1251:leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere 
./files/cookie:1252:effects -- this notion has no support in the plain facts.  If it could,

./files/cookie:1263:Thus the familiar argument that there is an instinctive desire for immortality,
./files/cookie:1265:recalled that there is also a powerful and widespread fear of annihilation,
./files/cookie:1266:and that this fear, on the same principle proves that there is nothing
./files/cookie:1267:beyond the grave.  Such childish "proofs" are typically theological, and

./files/cookie:1678:I have no doubt, and I think few people doubt, that atheists are as

./files/cookie:1752:money or votes or both.  I'm frankly sick and tired of the political

./files/cookie:5243:place" would turn into "the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful place".  Imagine

./files/science:2385:shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold,
./files/science:2386:as the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much

./files/science:2388:as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we

./files/science:2392:the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,
./files/science:2393:i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using
