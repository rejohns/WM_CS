SLIP DAYS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT: 0
CUMULATIVE SLIP DAYS: 0


1. [10pts] Normal case from specs: 10
       grep -n -H  elephant art computers | say -b -h elephant
   (3pts for banner; 4pts for 3 complete sayings output; 1pt
   for saying separators; 2pts for inverse video)

2. [2pts] Normal case, input redirected from file:2
       grep -n -H  elephant art computers > /tmp/X ; say -b -h elephant < /tmp/X
   (should behave exactly as first test)

3. [1 pt] Argument order: 1
        grep -n -H  elephant art computers | say -h -b elephant
   (should behave as first test)

3. [2pts] Normal case, no banner: 2
       grep -n -H  elephant art computers | say -h elephant
   (should behave as above tests but without a banner)

4. [3pts] No hits: 3
       grep -n -H snorple * | say snorple
   (specs explicitly require that this should produce no output)

5. [1pt] Invalid use: 1
       grep -n -H beer * | say
   (must abort with appropriate error message)

6. [4pts] Big output stress test (grep has >16000 hits): 4
       grep -n -H the * | say -b the
   (check banner accuracy, first saying, and last saying)

7. [1pt] Stupid user test 1:1
       grep the fortunes law | say the
   (no need to produce meaningful output, but shouldn't die
   ungracefully, and should produce error message)

8. [1pt] Stupid user test 2:1
       grep the fortunes | say the
   (should behave as in #7)

9. [3pts] Malicious user test:3
       grep -n -H the fortunes > /tmp/X
       (edit /tmp/X to swap first and last lines)
       say the < /tmp/X
   (should behave as in #7) 

10. [2pts] TA will visually check source to make sure storage is
    dynamically allocated. 2
