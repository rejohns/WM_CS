[10pts] Normal case from specs:
       grep -n -H  elephant art computers | say -b -h elephant
   (3pts for banner; 4pts for 3 complete sayings output; 1pt
   for saying separators; 2pts for inverse video)

[2pts] Normal case, input redirected from file:
       grep -n -H  elephant art computers > /tmp/X ; say -b -h elephant < /tmp/X
   (should behave exactly as first test)

[2pts] Invalid use:
       grep -n -H beer * | say
   (must abort with appropriate error message)

[4pts] Big output stress test (grep has >16000 hits):
       grep -n -H the * | say -b the
   (check banner accuracy, first saying, and last saying)

[2pts] TA will visually check source to make sure storage is
    dynamically allocated.
