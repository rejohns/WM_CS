<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Motivation</b></h3>
<p class="p3">There are many different ways to generate a Maze, for a nice summary click <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm"><span class="s1">here</span></a> and the section on Perfect Maze Creation Algorithms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Falstad's code comes with one method that includes rooms. We would like to have more alternatives to generate a maze.</p>
<p class="p3">For this project, you are tasked to extend it by one 
further method, namely a randomized version of Prim's algorithm ( see 
section "Perfect Maze Creation Algorithm" <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm"><span class="s1">here</span></a>).</p>
<p class="p3">If you are not familiar with Prim's algorithm consult any computer science algorithms text book, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm"><span class="s1">wikipedia</span></a> and in a variation for maze generation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation"><span class="s1">wikipedia</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">What to learn from this project:</p>
<p class="p3">- Deriving test cases for an existing class (here: 
MazeBuilder) that is multi-threaded to understand its behavior and to be
 able to recognize if modifications corrupt corruptness</p>
<p class="p3">- Using inheritance to share code across classes that solve same problems in different ways</p>
<p class="p3">- Exercising a test-driven approach when extending an existing code base<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">- Implementing an existing graph algorithm in Java</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Design decision</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The most straightforward design is to implement your new 
algorithm in a subclass of the existing MazeBuilder class. Since 
inheritance and abstract classes allow us to formulate generic solutions
 in a superclass and then have subclasses for more specific cases, let's
 exercise the following, slightly more challenging design.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">To retain a reasonably uniform design, use the existing 
MazeBuilder class as a super class and create 2 subclasses named 
MazeBuilderFalstad and MazeBuilderPrim that inherit from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">The method that generates a maze according to a particular
 algorithm should be an "abstract" method in the super class and being 
provided by the subclasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Of course, modifying an existing code base comes with the risk to introduce many subtle errors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">To limit the risk and localize changes, please use a class
 design that starts with the MazeBuilder class and uses inheritance to 
share code among Falstad's maze generator and your implementation of 
Prim's algorithm.</p>
<p class="p3">Create a junit test class that exercises all functionality
 of the superclass to check that the computed maze has all properties of
 a correct maze, the provided solution encoded in the dists array is 
correct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times; min-height: 18.0px"><br></h3>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>To do list:</b></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Create a junit test case for the MazeBuilder class first. Challenges:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li3">Be WARNED: this is more challenging than the tests for the Knight's tour and the Cells class.</li>
    <li class="li3">MazeBuilder operates its calculations in a separate thread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Figure
 out how the communication between MazeBuilder and Maze method works. 
Figure out how to give the MazeBuilder thread sufficient time to perform
 its calculations before a test proceeds in your junit test cases.</li>
    <li class="li3">MazeBuilder runs a randomized algorithm. For 
debugging it is better if we can control the random aspect. Check how 
this is possible with the existing Random library class that is used. 
(It requires you to understand the concept and next-to-nothing to 
program.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li class="li3">Answer Q1: how do you control that a particular call
 to the MazeBuilder will create the exactly same maze whenever it is 
performed?</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Identify which method currently generates the maze, 
i.e. makes the Cells object a valid maze with pathways connecting all 
possible locations in the maze.</li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li3">Answer Q2: classify the maze generation algorithm 
that Falstad implemented. How does this work? What kind of algorithm is 
it? ( see a list on the<a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm"><span class="s1"> Labyrinth page</span></a> for some possibilities).</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Create a class MazeBuilderFalstad.java that inherits 
from the MazeBuilder class, make the method that implements the maze 
generation an abstract method in MazeBuilder and move the code the new 
MazeBuilderFalstad.java class. Adapt your MazeBuilder test cases to this
 new setting and make sure the tests work on the new class design.</li>
  <li class="li3">Create a class MazeBuilderPrim.java that inherits from
 the MazeBuilder class, provide a skeleton method to implement the maze 
generation method for the MazeBuilder. Use the existing MazeBuilder test
 cases to derive new junit test cases for your new MazeBuilderPrim 
class.</li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li3">Exercise a test-driven design: write test cases before you implement Prim's algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Implement a RANDOMIZED version of Prim's algorithm for
 the MazeBuilderPrim. You can use as many extra methods and/or new 
classes to do this as you like. Falstad's maze generation code also 
comes up with a concept of "rooms". You can leave out rooms from your 
implementation of Prim's algorithm. If you like to include rooms (for 
some Bonus points), please add an additional subclass named 
MazeBuilderPrimWithRooms.java<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li3">Update your subversion repository whenever you made 
progress and got a particular feature or method going. Create a tag with
 a Release 3.0 before the drop out date (due date is recommended for 
your own sanity). Include your junit test cases in your release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li3">We will run and evaluate your tests as well as some 
additional ones of our own that will test MazeBuilderFalstad.java and 
MazeBuilderPrim.java based on existing public methods in 
MazeBuilder.java.</li>
  <li class="li3">We will evaluate your tests to see if they performs a rigid test and if they achieve a high coverage on the tested classes.</li>
  <li class="li3">Send answers to questions by email to Han Li hli06@email.wm.edu<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Grading</b>:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You will receive points for:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Correct answers to Q1 and Q2.</li>
  <li class="li3">An accessible Subversion repository with a tagged release 3.0<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li3">A class design with super class MazeBuilder, two 
subclasses MazeBuilderFalstad and MazeBuilderPrim that implement the 
abstract maze generation method from MazeBuilder.</li>
  <li class="li3">Test cases for MazeBuilderPrim and MazeBuilderFalstad exist and contain non-trivial test code</li>
  <li class="li3">MazeBuilderPrim implements Prim's algorithm in a randomized version to generate a maze without rooms</li>
  <li class="li3">Test code for MazeBuilderPrim and MazeBuilderFalstad 
can be executed, does not yield any failures and a reasonable coverage. 
Code is able to handle the fact that the maze generation is performed in
 a separate thread.</li>
</ul>
