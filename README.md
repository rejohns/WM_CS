Select work for William &amp; Mary computer science courses

## Spring 2012

**CS 301: Software Development**: Project-based introduction to software development principles. Semester-long project focused on extending functionality of Java maze application with 3D graphics, and porting the application to Android.

From the W&M course catalogue:

> An introduction to principled software development, emphasizing design at the module level as well as tools and techniques. Topics include object-oriented class design and implementation, abstraction techniques, debugging techniques, defensive programming, development and analysis tools, and testing. Emphasizes the role of the individual programmer in large software development projects. 

## Fall 2012

**CS 321 (now 421): Database Systems**: Introduction to relational database design and SQL. Code for semester-project, a baseball statistics database, included.

*Grade received: A*

From the W&M course catalogue:

>Design, organization and implementation of database management systems: file organization and processing, hierarchical, network, and relational models of database structure, data definition and data manipulation languages, security and integrity of databases, and the study of existing database implementations.

## Fall 2013

**CS 426: Simulation**: Introduction to discrete-event simulation, including random-number generation, output analysis, and Markov chains.

*Grade received: A*

From the W&M course catalogue:

>Introduction to simulation. Discrete and continuous stochastic models, random number generation, elementary statistics, simulation of queueing and inventory systems, discrete event simulation, point and interval parameter estimation. 

## Spring 2014

**CS 415: Systems Programming**: Introduction to low-level C programming, focusing on networking, inter-process communication, and shell scripting.

*Grade received: A*

From the W&M course catalogue:

>The design and implementation of programs which provide robust and efficient services to users of a computer. Macro processors; scripting languages; graphical interfaces; network programming. Unix and X are emphasized. 

**CS 678: Statistical Analysis of Simulation Models**: Using advanced statistical techniques to analyze input and output distributions and data for simulation models.

*Grade received: A-*

From the W&M course catalogue:

>This course introduces statistical techniques used in the analysis of simulation models. The first half of the course develops techniques for determining appropriate inputs to a simulation model, and the last half develops analysis techniques that are applied to the output of a simulation model.
