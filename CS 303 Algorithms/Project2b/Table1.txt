Table 1.  Timing results for the sorting algorithms with n = 250000.


[Replace this first block with a statement indicating whether the
results you are reporting are from a single run or the average over
multiple runs.  If the times are averaged over multiple runs, indicate
the number of runs.]

[Replace this second block with the name of the machine in the CS
system on which you ran your timing tests (e.g., bg1 or ...).  If your
tests were run on a machine not on the CS network, say so and indicate
the features of the machine upon which your tests were run.]

[Replace this third block with the list of options you used to compile
and create the executable used to run your timing tests.  In
particular, it is useful to know if you used compiler optimizations.]
